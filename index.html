                    <li>Since August 2021, I have been employed by Michigan State University as a member of the instructional team for CSE 102, which is the second most enrolled course at the university. CSE 102 focuses on teaching students critical thinking skills and introduces them to Python programming. I work alongside a staff of approximately 60-70 other instructional staff members, as well as 4 instructors. My specific responsibilities include leading class sections of 25-30 students and collaborating with other instructional staff to facilitate lesson plans and teaching strategies.</li>

Since 2018, I have worked as both a Camp Coordinator and a Building Manager for the City of Troy. These roles have provided me with valuable managerial experience, as I have had to manage teams of staff members ranging in size from 10-15 individuals. Additionally, I have also worked as a part-time videographer for the Troy School District, which has given me experience in a different field of work. Overall, my work experience has helped me to develop strong organizational and communication skills that I can apply to my future career.</li>
